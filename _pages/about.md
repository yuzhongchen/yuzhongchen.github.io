I am currently a PhD student in Computer Science at [Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu), [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu) starting from September, 2024.

My research interests lie in robot perception and mobile applications, especially on their applications. Hoping to develop robots that can reduce human workloads.


I am honored to be advised by [Professor Chen Feng](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/chen-feng) at [AI4CE](https://ai4ce.github.io) starting from September 2024.
